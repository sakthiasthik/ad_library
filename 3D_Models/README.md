# 3D Models 🏗️

This folder contains **3D models** for components used in the **Footprints** folder. These models are in formats compatible with Altium Designer and allow for accurate 3D visualization in PCB layouts.

### 📂 **Files Included:**
- **.STL** and **.STEP** files: These are 3D models of components in widely used formats.

### 🛠️ **How to Use:**
1. In Altium Designer, when editing a footprint, link the corresponding 3D model file from this folder.
2. Go to `Properties > 3D Model` for a footprint and browse to the relevant 3D model file.
3. The 3D model will be displayed alongside the footprint in the 3D PCB view.

### 📅 **Planned Updates:**
- More 3D models will be added for components as the library grows.
