# Footprints 🛠️

This folder contains **Altium footprint libraries** converted from **KiCad 9.0** libraries. These footprints define the physical dimensions and pad layouts for various components used in PCB design.

### 📂 **Files Included:**
- **.PcbLib** files: These are the footprint libraries in **Altium format**.

### 🛠️ **How to Use:**
1. Open Altium Designer.
2. Go to `File > Open`, and select the desired `.PcbLib` file from this folder.
3. Import the footprints into your PCB layout by selecting them from the **Libraries** panel.
4. These footprints are ready to be placed on your PCB designs.

### 🏗️ **3D Model Linking:**
The footprints in this folder are already linked to corresponding 3D models (if available in the **/3D_Models** folder). This allows for **real-time 3D visualization** while designing.

### 📅 **Planned Updates:**
- More footprints will be added regularly to cover a wider range of components.
