# Schematic Symbols 📐

This folder contains **Altium schematic symbols** that are converted from **KiCad 9.0** libraries, fine-tuned for use in **Altium Designer**.

### 📂 **Files Included:**
- **.SchLib** files: These are the schematic symbol libraries in **Altium format**.

### 🛠️ **How to Use:**
1. Open Altium Designer.
2. Go to `File > Open`, and select the desired `.SchLib` file from this folder.
3. Once opened, you can import symbols directly into your schematics by adding them from the **Libraries** panel.
4. Symbols are now ready to be used for wiring and schematic design.

### 📅 **Planned Updates:**
- Additional symbols will be added regularly to expand the collection.
