Integrated Library 📦
This folder contains Altium Integrated Libraries (.IntLib) that combine schematic symbols, footprints, and 3D models into a single library for easy use in Altium Designer.

📂 Files Included:
.IntLib files: Integrated libraries containing symbols, footprints, and 3D models in Altium format.
These libraries are created by linking or importing the respective components from the main folders:

- [Schematic Symbols](./Schematic_Symbols)
- [Footprints](./Footprints)
- [3D Models](./3D_Models)

This makes it easy to distribute and reuse components without needing to manage multiple files.

🛠️ How to Use:
Open Altium Designer.

Go to File > Open, and select the desired .IntLib file from this folder.

Import components into your schematic or PCB layout by selecting them from the Libraries panel.

All related components (symbols, footprints, and 3D models) will be ready to use.

📅 Planned Updates:
More integrated libraries will be added regularly.
